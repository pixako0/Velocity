# Velocity
My intake assignment for BUas. The theme was 'collide'.
## Installation
git clone https://github.com/pixako0/Velocity.git
Cloning the GitHub as of now will result in linker errors, for working code download from http://fileupload.nont123.nl/velocity.zip

## Controls
- `W`: Accelerate your ship
- `A`: Rotate your ship to the left
- `D`: Rotate your ship to the right
- `space`: Shoot a rocket
- `enter`: Respawn
Additionally you can use the arrow keys to move around just like the W, A, D keys. The up key corresponds to the W key, the left key corresponds to the A key, the right key corresponds to the D key.
